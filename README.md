## Description

This is a simple landing page project showcasing a cute kitten and providing a way for visitors to contact. I was tasked to make sure the use of semantic HTML elements, multiple color schemes, font family, and proper headings. I also made sure to use universal, element, and class selectors in CSS. To maintain accessibility standards an alt attribute was added for the image. This page simply displays a cute image of a kitten, has navagation links, and a contact form. 

## Features

- Display of a super cute kitten image.
- Navigation links to Github, Portfolio, and Contact section.
- A contact form for users to get in touch.
- Sticky header and footer for consistent navigation.
